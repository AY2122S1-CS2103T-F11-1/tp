# About

* This is a software engineering project by team F11-1 for NUS module CS2103T of AY2021-22 Sem 1.   
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* The starting codebase is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC) than 
what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
