TimesTable is a **desktop app for managing your tuition students and classes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TimesTable can get your class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer, if you do not, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-linux).

1. Download the latest `timestable.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TimesTable.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample student data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press 'Enter' to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing 'Enter' will open the help window.<br>
   Here are some example commands which you can use on our sample students data before using your own students data:

   * **`add `**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 nok/ n/Jack Doe p/10987654 e/jackd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the TimesTable.

   * **`delete `**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   
   * **`sort `**`name asc` : Sorts the students by their name in ascending alphabetic order.
    
   * **`addclass `**`cn/Sec 4 A Maths ct/FRI 11:30-13:30 r/70 l/Nex Tuition Center`: Adds a new class with name 'Sec 4 A Maths', with class timing MON 11.30-13:30, with hourly rate of $70, at Nex Tuition Center.
    
   * **`addtoclass `**`1 2 3`: Adds the 2nd and 3rd student in the student list in the `students` tab into the 1st class in the `classes` tab

   * **`view `**`classes` : Changes the tab the user is on to the `classes` tab which displays all the classes.
   
   * **`view `**`timetable` : Changes the tab the user is on to the `timetable` tab which displays a timetable with all the classes. 
   
   * **`exit `** : Exits the app.

1. Once you are ready to fill in Timestable with your own students, simply use the  **`clear`** command to delete all the sample students, instead of having to delete them one by one.
   Now you can start putting your students into Timestable.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is an input which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `listclass`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For commands that require next-ok-kin (NOK) information, all inputs regarding NOK should be after `nok/` and all
  inputs regarding the student should be before `nok/`. Timestable does not allow order swap!<br>
  e.g. `n/John p/97833242 … /nok n/Harry p/87738383 …` `John` and `97833242` are information belonging to the student
  and `John`'s NOK's name is `Harry` whose phone number is `87738383`.

* For commands that require index (e.g. `editclass`, `addtoclass`, etc), zero, negative and out-of-range indices are 
rejected with an error message. (Out of range means that the index entered is greater than the number of entries in
a class or student list)
  
* For commands that alters the list of students (eg. `findname`, `findtag`, `sort name asc`), the displayed
  changes for students will be shown in both the `Students` tab as well as the `Classes` tab.  
  This means that when students are filtered by their `name` and `tag`, they will be filtered by their `name` and `tag` in the `Classes` tab as well.  
  Likewise, when students are sorted by their names, they will be sorted in the `Classes` tab as well.

* The `list` and `listclass` commands can be used to show the original lists of students and classes respectively.

* Class size will **not** be affected by filtering students (using FindName or FindTag).

* All arguments can have a maximum of 85 characters except otherwise stated.

</div>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

```

* This is a command that requires next-of-kin (NOK) information.
* This command is split into two segments (excluding command keyword). The first segment are the inputs before
  `nok/` and the second segment are the inputs after `nok/`.
    * Inputs in the first segment are about student information whereas inputs in the second segment are about NOK's information.
* The order of input within its own segment is swappable, but the segments themselves are not.
* The command does not allow adding duplicate students - as defined as the student having the same name, ignoring case.
* `NAME` can have a maximum of 120 characters.
* `PHONE_NUMBER` has to be between 3-25 numbers.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
For commands that alters the list of students (eg. `findname`, `findtag`, `sort name asc`), the displayed
  changes for students will be shown in both the `Students` tab as well as the `Classes` tab.  
  This means that when students are filtered by their `name` and `tag`, they will be filtered by their `name` and `tag` in the `Classes` tab as well.  
  Likewise, when students are sorted by their names, they will be sorted in the `Classes` tab as well.
  
The `list` and `listclass` commands can be used to show the original lists of students and classes respectively. 

Class size will **not** be affected by filtering students (using FindName or FindTag).
</div>

### Locating students by name: `findname`
<hr>

Finds students whose `NAME` contain any of the given keywords.  
Note that if you want to display the entire list of students again, run `list`.

Format:
```
findname NAME [, [NAME]...]
```

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The search terms are split by commas. e.g. `findname alex lim, bernice yu`
* Only the student's `NAME` is searched.
* Partial matches will still be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one search term will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `findname alex lim, bernice yu` will return `Alex Lim`, `Bernice Yu`.
* The entire search term is used for matching e.g. `findname Alex L` will match `Alex Lim`
    but not `Alex Yu`

Examples:
* `findname John` returns `john` and `John Doe` in both `Students` and `Classes` tab.
* `findname alex, david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li` in both `Students` and `Classes` tab.<br>

Class size will **not** be affected by filtering students (using FindName or FindTag).
</div>

### Locating class by class timing : `findclass`
<hr>

Finds a class whose `CLASS_TIMING` matches the given keyword.  
Note that if you want to display the list of classes again, run `listclass`.

Format: `findclass CLASS_TIMING`

<!---todo fill in inner working--->

* The valid keywords for `CLASS_TIMING` are limited to the following types:
    1. 3 letter abbreviation for day of the week e.g. `Mon`, `Tue`, etc.
    2. Time expressed in HH:MM-HH:MM format   e.g. `11:30-12:30`, `15:00-16:00`, etc. 
        * `CLASS_TIMING` can only start and end at the hour mark or half hour mark, but can also end at 23:59 hours.
* Either a single keyword or two keywords of different types should be provided otherwise no classes would be returned.
* Multiple keywords of the same type (eg Mon Tue) would not return any classes, because the command finds classes which contain both timings (Mon and Tue), and 
    it is currently not possible to have a class with two different timings (ie a class that occurs on both Monday and Tuesday or both `10:00-12:00` and `17:00-19:00`)
    * Important clarification: In TimesTable, class refers to a single slot per week in the timetable.
* If two keywords are entered, then the class returned would be the one that match all the keywords
  (see example below).


Examples:
1. Single keyword
    * `findclass mon` returns all classes on Monday
    * `findclass 10:00-12:00` returns all classes scheduled for `10:00 to 12:00` no matter which day of the week it belongs
      to
2. Two keywords
    * `findclass mon 11:00-12:00` returns the exact class on `Mon at 11:00-12:00`.
    * `findclass tue 11:00-12:00` returns the exact class on `Tue at 11:00-12:00`.
3. Negative examples (Two or more keywords of the same type)
    * `findclass mon tue` returns nothing.
    * `findclass 09:00-10:30 11:00-12:00` returns nothing.
   

### Locating class by class name: `findclassname`
<hr>

Finds a class whose class name matches the given keywords.  
Note that if you want to display the list of classes again, run `listclass`.

Format:
```
findclassname CLASS_NAME [, [CLASS_NAME]...]
```
<!---todo fill in inner working--->

* The search is case-insensitive `PHYSICS` will match 'physics'.
* The search terms are split by commas. e.g. `findclassname sec 4 physics, jc math`
* Only the class' `CLASS_NAME` is searched.
* Partial matches will still be matched e.g. `Phy` will match `Physics`.
* Classes matching at least one search term will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `findclassname sec 4 phy, jc math` will return `sec 4 physics`, `jc mathematics`.
* The entire search term is used for matching e.g. `findclassname sec 4 phy` will match `sec 4 physics`
  but not `sec 4 maths`
  
Examples:
* `findclassname math` returns all the classes with math in the class name.
* `findclassname Sec, 4, maths` returns all the classes with `sec` or `4` or `maths` in the class name. Hence,
  class with name `sec 4 physics` and class with name `JC maths` would both be returned.

### Locating students by tag: `findtag`
<hr>

Finds students whose `TAG`s contain any of the given keywords.  
Note that if you want to display the entire list of students again, run `list`.

Format:
```
findtag KEYWORD [, [KEYWORD]...]
```

* Search terms can partially match the tag, or the entire tag, e.g. `math` for all `A Math` and `C Math` tags, or `A Math` for the `A Math` tag.
* Search terms are separated by commas. e.g. `findtag math, physics` will find students
  with tags containing `math` or `physics`.
* Students matching at least one search term will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `findtag math, physics` will return students with the `Math` `TAG` but no `Physics` `TAG`,
  students with only the`Physics` `TAG` but no `Math` `TAG`, and students with both `TAG`s.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `math` will match `Math`.

Examples:
* `findtag math` returns `Alex Yeoh` with the `A Math` `TAG` and `John Doe` with the `C Math` `TAG` in both `Students` and `Classes` tab.
* `findtag math, physics` returns `Alex Yeoh` with the `A Math` and `Biology` `TAG`s in both `Students` and `Classes` tab.
  <br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
For commands that alters the list of students (eg. `findname`, `findtag`, `sort name asc`), the displayed
  changes for students will be shown in both the `Students` tab as well as the `Classes` tab.

### Viewing of different tabs: `view`
<hr>

Views an existing tab in the TimesTable without the need to use the mouse to click.

Format:
```
view TAB_TO_VIEW   
```

* `TAB_TO_VIEW` has to be an existing tab in Timestable (`students`, `classes`, `timetable`).

Examples:
* `view timetable` switches the displayed tab to be the `timetable` tab.

### Selecting of classes: `class`
<hr>

Selects a class in the class tab and displays its students without the need to use the mouse to double click the respective class.

Format:
```
class CLASS_INDEX   
```

* Selected class will not be highlighted in the same way as when you click on a class using the mouse.
* `CLASS_INDEX` must be an index of a class that exists in the displayed class list.

Examples:
* `class 1` selects the class with `CLASS_INDEX` of `1` and displays its students in the class tab.

### Listing all students : `list`
<hr>

Shows a list of all students in the Students tab.

Format: `list`

### Listing all the classes: `listclass`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Timestable home folder.

**Q**: Are you going to add XXX feature? What features are you planning to add?<br>
**A**: I'm glad you asked! We're currently planning to add the following features:

### Upcoming Features:

#### Payment Management with Invoice

Different classes you teach will have different hourly rates, and they will of course have varying lengths and frequencies. 
Having to keep track of how much someone has to pay and whether they have paid is a major source of stress.

We recognise this demand, and thus are working on this feature for you to easily track required payments to students.

A work in progress sneak peak of the feature is shown below.  

![UpcomingFeature](images/UpcomingFeature.png)  

After a class, just input the time taught for that class and mark the attendance of those present.
  
For each student present, TimesTable will take the hourly rate multiplied by the 
session length for each person present to calculate the amount that each student has to pay.  

The session length field is useful when the class length goes beyond the intended length or when the class cuts short.  

This information will then be consolidated in an invoice to be generated.

When you want to generate a new invoice, simply use the 'createinvoice' command. Invoices will be generated for all 
students of the selected class. These invoices will use the session attendances recorded since the last invoice, generating
a table with the relevant information such as session date, session length, hourly rate, student name, and so on. You will
also be able to set the due date for the invoice. 

An example of the invoice generated is shown below.

![InvoiceExample](images/InvoiceExample.png)

With this invoice generation feature, you will easily be able to charge the correct amount to your clients
and you would also not have to worry about providing evidence. TimesTable will take care of it for you.

In addition to invoice generation, we are also working on an invoice management feature that will allow you to track
the status of each invoice. You will be able to mark the invoices as paid, and archive them. TimesTable will also
