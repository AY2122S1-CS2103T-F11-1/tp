### Project: TimesTable

TimesTable is a desktop address book plus planner application for tuition teachers to keep track of their students
and classes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 17 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the skeleton of the tabs
    * What it does: Added the base skeleton of the 3 tabs - `Students`, `Classes` and `Timetable`
    * Justification: This feature is a crucial foundation for our application. I had to implement this before my teammates could work on their respective tabs.
    * Highlights: This enhancement was the start of our evolution from the original AB3 into what we have today. It improved the entire UI and allowed us to have multiple tabs which users could view.
    * Pull request: [\#73](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/73)
    
* **New Feature**: Added the Timetable UI
    * What it does: Displays the tuition classes of the user in a timetable format in the `Timetable` Tab.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user now sees all his/her tuition classes in a timetable view, improving the user experience.
    * Highlights: This enhancement revamped the entire UI of the app. It required an in-depth analysis of all possible design patterns to upgrade the UI. The implementation was challenging as it required addition of many new components to build the entire timetable component.

    * Pull requests: [\#81](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/81), [\#97](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/97), [\#114](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/114), [\#136](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/136), [\#138](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/138)
  
* **New Feature**: Added the `sort` feature.
    * What it does: Sorts the students and classes based on the specified parameter in the specified order.
    * Justification: This feature improves the user experience as it allows the user to arrange the list of students and/or classes in the order the user would like. It is also one of the basic features an address book application should have.
    * Highlights: Implementing this `sort` command was relatively easier than the Timetable UI. However, the challenging part was choosing what parameter to allow the user to sort the students or classes by. The parameters I allowed to be sorted by were the student's name and the class' timing. I believe that these are the two parameters which the user would sort them by the most, thus I selected them.
    * Pull requests: [\#126](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/126), [\#129](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/129), [\#132](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/132), [\#240](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/240), [\#250](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/250)

* **New Feature**: Added the `view` feature.
   * What it does: Opens the tab inputted by the user.
   * Justification: This feature was crucial as it tailored our app towards users who does not like using the mouse or voice commands. Implementing this means the user can now switch tabs without the need of a mouse. This feature also played a crucial role in other commands. The commands related to TuitionClass, such as `addToClass`, `editClass`, `removeClass` etc used this feature to automatically switch to the `Classes` Tab when they were called. Similarly, for commands related to the Student, such as `add`, `edit` and `list` etc used this feature to automatically switch to the `Students` Tab when they were called.
   * Highlights: Implementing this `view` command required an in-depth analysis of the possible design patterns. I decided to use the Observer pattern here. In this case, the MainWindow was the Observer and observed the Commands. Calling of this command would fire the updateView method of the Observers to switch the tab to the tab indicated by the user.
